## About This Repository

This is my developer log for the **Community Keeps Building (CKB) Builders Track** - a 12-week programme focused on learning smart contract development on the [Nervos CKB](https://www.nervos.org/) blockchain.

The repo tracks my progression from foundational concepts through to building real applications on CKB, including weekly progress reports, completed exercise code, screenshots, and project work.
