## Tips for Staying on Track

1. **Do the report first thing each week** - even if it's just bullet points, fill it in as you go
2. **Screenshot everything** - every successful transaction, every completed exercise
3. **Commit daily** - even small changes show consistent effort
4. **Ask for help early** - reach out to Neon and DevRel when stuck, don't waste a week being blocked
5. **The app project matters most** - exercises prove you learned, the app proves you can build
